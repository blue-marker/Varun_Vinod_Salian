      <description>Final Image resulted from GANs   Deep neural networks are used mainly for supervised learning: classification or regression. Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling
While there are many approaches used for generative modeling, a Generative Adversarial Network takes the following approach:
  GANs model   There are two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; (picked from the training data) or &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; (generated by the generator).</description>

      <description>Image Captioner   Image Captioner takes in any image and produces a caption based on whats in the image. This is build using Deep Learning and the application is build using Flask framework. The model is a combination of CNN and LSTM. The model is trained on both image and it&amp;rsquo;s respective caption. The CNN model ( transfer learning is used here specifically vgg16 ) helps to extract the image patterns into some vector and the words in the caption is converted into index no and then it is feed into a word embedding.</description>

      <description>Youtube Video Analyzer; GUI built using Tkinter   This is a Data Science cum python project
  Data Extraction using Web Scraping &amp;amp; Youtube API : This was the challenging part where required data needed to be extracted. I have used selenium as well beautiful to scrap data from youtube. Some datas like comments cannot be scrapped , for that I used Youtube API to extract some number of comments from videos.</description>
